**Lead Scoring Case Study**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for lead scoring. Lead scoring is a crucial task in sales and marketing, aiming to prioritize and allocate resources efficiently to leads that are most likely to convert into customers.

### Overview

Lead scoring involves predicting the likelihood of a lead to convert based on various attributes and behaviors. In this case study, we explore a dataset containing information about leads and their conversion status. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

### Repository Contents

- **lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire pipeline of the lead scoring case study. It includes detailed explanations, code, and visualizations at each step.

### Running the Notebook

You can run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click on `File` -> `Open notebook`.
3. Select `GitHub` tab.
4. Paste the following URL: `https://github.com/kailash105/lead-scoring-case-study`.
5. Choose `lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb`.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell and understand the lead scoring process.

### Data

The dataset used in this case study contains information about leads including various attributes and their conversion status. The dataset is provided along with the notebook (`Leads.csv`).

### Machine Learning Models Used

In this case study, we explore the following machine learning models for lead scoring:

1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Logistic regression is a linear model used for binary classification tasks, such as predicting whether a lead will convert or not.

2. **Random Forest**:
   - Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

3. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**:
   - GBM builds an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially. Each new tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones, leading to a strong predictive model.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - SVM is a supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis. In lead scoring, SVM can be applied to find the hyperplane that best separates leads that convert from those that don't, based on the input features.

5. **Neural Networks**:
   - Deep learning models, particularly neural networks, can be utilized for lead scoring. Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns in the data and can be trained to predict lead conversion probabilities.

6. **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**:
   - These are gradient boosting implementations optimized for performance and accuracy. They offer efficient tree-based learning algorithms and can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks. It assigns a class label or predicts the value of a target variable by finding the majority class among the k nearest neighbors.

### Dependencies

The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab environment which already includes most of the necessary dependencies. However, if additional packages are needed, they can be installed using `!pip install <package-name>` command.
