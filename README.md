**Lead Scoring Case Study**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for lead scoring. Lead scoring is a crucial task in sales and marketing, aiming to prioritize and allocate resources efficiently to leads that are most likely to convert into customers.

### Overview

Lead scoring involves predicting the likelihood of a lead to convert based on various attributes and behaviors. In this case study, we explore a dataset containing information about leads and their conversion status. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

### Repository Contents

- **lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire pipeline of the lead scoring case study. It includes detailed explanations, code, and visualizations at each step.

### Running the Notebook

You can run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click on `File` -> `Open notebook`.
3. Select `GitHub` tab.
4. Paste the following URL: `https://github.com/kailash105/lead-scoring-case-study`.
5. Choose `lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb`.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell and understand the lead scoring process.

### Data

The dataset used in this case study contains information about leads including various attributes and their conversion status. The dataset is provided along with the notebook (`Leads.csv`).

### Dependencies

The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab environment which already includes most of the necessary dependencies. However, if additional packages are needed, they can be installed using `!pip install <package-name>` command.
