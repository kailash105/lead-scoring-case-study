**Lead Scoring Case Study**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for lead scoring. Lead scoring is a crucial task in sales and marketing, aiming to prioritize and allocate resources efficiently to leads that are most likely to convert into customers.

### Overview

Lead scoring involves predicting the likelihood of a lead to convert based on various attributes and behaviors. In this case study, we explore a dataset containing information about leads and their conversion status. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

### Repository Contents

- **lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire pipeline of the lead scoring case study. It includes detailed explanations, code, and visualizations at each step.

### Getting Started

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kailash105/lead-scoring-case-study.git
